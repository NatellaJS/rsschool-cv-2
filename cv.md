## About me:
I’m interested in web development because this profession provides endless possibilities for professional growth, besides there’s a great number of free high-quality resources for education and a large community of developers.
My strong point is the desire to learn something new. I am convinced that the ability to study a lot and work hard will allow to become a cool web-developer and a broad-profile specialist (databases, backend programming).

## Skills:
* HTML
* CSS/SASS
* JavaScript (basic)
* Git/Github
* VS Code
* Adobe Photoshop
